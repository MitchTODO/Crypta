## Requirements

- Crypta iOS
    - iOS 15.2+
    - Xcode 13.2.1+
    - Swift 5+
    - Cocoapods

## Quick Start

### iOS App

1. Open your terminal and Git clone the repo

       git clone https://github.com/MitchTODO/Crypta.git

2. Install Podfile

   With the same terminal cd into Crypta2.0 and install

       cd Crypta2.0

       pod install

   If your running on M1 chip use

       arch -x86_64 pod install

   Wait for the pods to install

3. Start Xcode and open up the workspace

A good place

### Smart Contract

Soon to come.
As of now the contract is deployed on Alfajores Testnet and the ABI is still the same.

## About

This project is a submission for an Gitcoin bounty by the Celo Network. The goal was to develop a native iOS reference application to inspire web3 projects.

## Components

Project consist of two components the App and Smart contract.

### Smart Contract

The smart contract has a DAO style architecture allowing groups, proposals and voting to take place and managed. I feel this contract can easily be extended and is a good starting point for reference.

### Crypta iOS

The app has a simplistic design that can be broken down into three sections views, services and contract.

- Views:    SwiftUI views and viewModels that make up the UI

- Services: async methods and variables that piggy back on the web3swift library.

- Contract: variables that make up the contract, network and wallet
